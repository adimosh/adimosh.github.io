# My open-source projects

I have started some open-source projects to offer some extra value to the open-source
community and to ease my work on commercial projects. All of them are released under
the MIT license, as it is the simplest and offers the most liberty.

Should anyone wish to contribute to any of my open-source projects, please read the
[contributing guidelines](contributingguidelines) first and feel free to create as
many pull requests as you wish.

These projects are provided 100% free of charge, and no donations will be taken.

## IX.Retry

The first open-source project that I started, [IX.Retry](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Retry)
is a library for re-attempting possibly failed operations.

## IX.Observable

A major open-source project, [IX.Observable](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Observable)
offers a more proper set of observable collections, like an observable dictionary, an
observable queue, an observable stack and an observable master/slave collection, which
acts as an aggregation of multiple collections, etc.

Latest release is:
[![IX.Observable GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adimosh/ix.Observable.svg)](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Observable)

NuGet release:

## IX.Math

Another major open-source project, [IX.Math](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Math) deals
with transforming text into something meaningful from a computer perspective. Input x+2
and it generates a delegate that requires one parameter and returns that value,
incremented by 2.

Latest release is:
[![IX.Math GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adimosh/ix.math.svg)](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Math)

## IX.Abstractions

This project came as a result of too many "Why didn't they just make this mockable in the
first place?" questions. [IX.Abstractions](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Abstractions) (as
the name implies) abstracts some code that was made to be built-in, like file and folder
operations, by forcing the functionality into neatly-organized interfaces that mimic their
original functionality.

Latest release is:
[![IX.Abstractions GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adimosh/ix.Abstractions.svg)](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Abstractions)

NuGet release:
[![IX.Abstractions NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/IX.Abstractions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IX.Abstractions/)
(stable) and
[![IX.Abstractions NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/IX.Abstractions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IX.Abstractions/)
(unstable, if any)

## IX.Undoable

The first project that mostly deals with the UI side,
[IX.Undoable](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Undoable) offers a framework for undo and redo
operations.

Latest release is:
[![IX.Undoable GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adimosh/ix.Undoable.svg)](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.Undoable)

NuGet release:

## IX.StandardExtensions

The last actively-developed project on the list,
[IX.StandardExtensions](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.StandardExtensions) is a set of
extension methods made in order to make life easier and more standardized when developing
with .NET.

Latest release is:
[![IX.StandardExtensions GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/adimosh/ix.StandardExtensions.svg)](https://github.com/adimosh/IX.StandardExtensions)
