# My religious views

I was raised in an Orthodox Christian in my early yars, and, before going to school, I finally approached my parents with questions about faith, and
was told that they have none. I had grown out of any religion by th time I finished grade school.

It was until my marriage (which we held a religious ceremony for, for the sake of our guests and family) that I found out that i had in fact been
baptized as a Catholic, at the insistence of my paternal grandmother. I like to tell this as a funny fact, as I have never practiced any Catholic rituals,
as I did not even know I had been one.

I am now an atheist, and have been so for many years.
