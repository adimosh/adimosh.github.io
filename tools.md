# Tools I work with

## Main tools

In my professional activity as a developer, I work mainly in the [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) suite of tools. I work with the main Visual Studio IDE most of the time, and occasionally with Visual Studio Code.

I have worked with Visual Studio since Visual Studio 6, and quickly adopted Visual Studio .NET when it became available. Initially reluctant to switch from C/C++ to C#, the transition became extremely smooth once I started to look for more structured languages. I briefly forayed in the Java landscape, finding it mostly hideous, then discovered C# and settled in on it.

Besides Visual Studio, a great deal of help comes from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)' [dotUltimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/) suite. I am especially fond of ReSharper as an IDE aid, and dotPeek as a disassembler for .NET.

## Extensions to Visual Studio and ReSharper

For extensions, I use the great suite of extensions by [Mads Kristensen](https://github.com/madskristensen), which are too many to count and name, and which all work like a charm. At the moment of this page's last update, they were available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=Mads%20Kristensen&target=VS&category=Tools&vsVersion=&subCategory=All&sortBy=Relevance).

I also use [GhostDoc](https://submain.com/ghostdoc/) by [SubMain](https://submain.com/) for documentation purposes, usually in conjunction with some form of XML doc parser like [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) or [XMLDocMarkdown](https://ejball.com/XmlDocMarkdown/).
