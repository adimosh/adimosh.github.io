# Tools I work with

In my professional activity as a developer, I work mainly in the [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) suite of tools. I work with the main Visual Studio IDE most of the time, and occasionally with Visual Studio Code.

I have worked with Visual Studio since Visual Studio 6, and quickly adopted Visual Studio .NET when it became available. Initially reluctant to switch from C/C++ to C#, the transition became extremely smooth once I started to look for more structured languages. I briefly forayed in the Java landscape, finding it mostly hideous, then discovered C# and settled in on it.
