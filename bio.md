# My short bio

## Early life and education

I was born on March 31st, 1985, in the city of [Târgu-Mureș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2rgu_Mure%C8%99),
[Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). My parents were both, at the time, electronic engineers.

I attended the local Domus Kindergarten where I was first taught the basics of th Englih language, as well as how to read. I then
attended the also-local Grade School #10 (presently part of the [Dacia Gymnasium](http://educatie.inmures.ro/despre-noi-gimnaziul-dacia-grpn16.html))
where I was found to excel in mathematics, physics and computer science. During this time, I briefly took piano lessons.

I lived in a standard Communist-era-style block of flats until the age of 15, when I moved inside a large house near the city center.

I attended the ["Alexandru Papiu Ilarian" National College](http://papiu.ro), where I further followed the Mathematics - Computer Science - English path.
I was already working as an intern in my father's computer company by the time I graduated.

At this time, I also acquired my Drivers' License. By this time, I had been to courses for Hungarian and German languages, and the French language was
part of my curriculum.

After passing the Baccalaureate examination in 2004, I went on to study Computer Science at the ["Petru Maior" University](http://www.upm.ro/), a state
institution. After the first year, I also started to attend Law school at the ["Dimitrie Cantemir" University](http://www.cantemir.ro/), a private
institution. After one year, after noticing the difference in treatment of th student between state institutions and private institutions, I decided
to permanently drop out of the Computer Science courses and focus on Law school, a decision aided by scheduling conflicts between exams, my working day,
as well as advice from my friend (who himself was a lawyer). I went on to become licensed in legal practice, but have never practiced as a main career.

After finishing Law school, I re-enroled in the "Petru Maior" University for a Master's Degree course in Information Technology, having no other choice
in the institution, which I graduated, but never pursued as a degree.

## Time in Cluj-Napoca

I moved to [Cluj-Napoca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca) at the beginning of 2012, and got accustomed to a much bigger, much more crowded city.
I went job-hopping for a few years, ensuring further financial gains and recognition in the market.

I also started to write open-source code, and to take notice of local developer events.

During this time, I married my wife and, together, we managed to purchase, build and decorate a home for us.

In 2016, our baby girl was born.
